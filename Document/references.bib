	abstract = {It is very difﬁcult for both theories and computational methods to predict the superconducting transition temperatures (Tc) of superconductors for strongly correlated systems, in which high-temperature superconductivity emerges. Exploration of new superconductors still relies on the experience and intuition of experts, and is largely a process of experimental trial and error. In one study, only 3\% of the candidate materials showed superconductivity [1]. Here we report an interdisciplinary attempt for ﬁnding new superconductors based on deep learning. We represented the periodic table in a way that allows a deep learning model to learn it. Although we used only the chemical composition of materials as information, we obtained an R2 value of 0.92 for predicting Tc for materials in a database of superconductors. We obtained three remarkable results. The deep learning method can predict superconductivity for a material with a precision of 62\%, which shows the usefulness of the model; it found the recently discovered superconductor CaBi2, which is not in the superconductor database; and it found Fe-based high-temperature superconductors (discovered in 2008) from the training data before 2008. These results open the way for the discovery of new high-temperature superconductor families.},
